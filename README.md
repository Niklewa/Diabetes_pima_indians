# Diabetes predictor

Pima Indians Diabetes Database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database    

Data analysis and model building notebook: https://github.com/Niklewa/Diabetes_pima_indians/blob/main/Diabetes_pima_indians.ipynb

<p align="justify"> In this project I conduct an analyzys of Pima Indians Diabetes Database. My main goal was to build a model upon this data, one that will enable making predictions about one health condition, mainly predicting (to some degreee of accuracy) if an individual has diabetes.     
  The analysis and model training was done in a google colab notebook. The second part of this project, that is, building the predictor, was done in pycharm. Later, upon pycharm file, streamlit app was build. The process of app building had to be done in a desktop python environment, it is a technical requirement of streamlit app engine. </p>
